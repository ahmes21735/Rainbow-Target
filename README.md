# Rainbow-Target
This project was done for a school assignment. The following code includes a Python animation of a ball bouncing around a room that contains a 6-ring target. 
In every frame of the animation, the colour of the ball changes depending on which ring of the target the centre of the ball is in.
The largest ring should touch all 4 walls of the screen, and its rings should be evenly spaced and slightly wider than the ball.
The target should be drawn using a for-loop rather than 6 separate create_oval commands.
